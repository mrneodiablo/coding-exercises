# My Daily Coding Practice

## Why I Code Every Day

AI can do everything, AI can generate code instantly, It's easy to make a prompt and let AI do the work. But that's not how I want to do, I hate to let my mind become lazy. I want to keep my brain sharp, I want to keep my systems thinking strong.

### The Truth About AI and Learning

AI is a powerful tool, but it's not a replacement for understanding. When you rely on AI for everything:
- Your problem-solving muscles gone flabby
- You lose the ability to think systematically
- You forget the fundamentals that connect everything together

**I code every day to maintain my systems thinking.**

## What This Repository Means

This isn't just a collection of solved problems. It's proof that I:
- **Practice fundamentals daily** - Because basics are the foundation of everything
- **Think through problems myself** - Before I let AI help me optimize
- **Connect the dots** - Seeing patterns across data structures, algorithms, and real problems
- **Stay sharp** - Exercising my brain like a muscle that needs daily training

**No copy-paste. No blind AI generation. Just me, the problem, and my brain.**

## The Practice Structure

```
leetcode/          - Problem solving skills
neetcode/          - Systematic pattern recognition  
udemy-*/           - Deep understanding of data structures
```

Each file has:
- My solution
- Unit tests AI write
- Automated checks to keep me honest

## Systems Thinking

This isn't about memorizing solutions. It's about:

1. **Recognizing patterns** - "Oh, this is just a graph traversal problem"
2. **Building mental models** - Understanding how data flows and transforms
3. **Connecting concepts** - Seeing how a tree traversal relates to file system operations
4. **Thinking in abstractions** - Moving from specific problems to general solutions

**Not because I need to pass interviews. Because I refuse to let AI make me stupid.**


**AI can generate code. But only I can understand my specific problem and context.**

## The Setup

All code has automated testing:
```bash
# Each commit runs:
- Flake8 (code quality)
- Pylint (deeper analysis)  
- Unit tests (my solutions actually work)
```

This keeps me honest. No shortcuts.

## My Philosophy

```
Fundamentals → Patterns → Systems Thinking → Problem Solving → Real Solutions
```

AI is a tool. My brain is the engineer.

## Recognition of Patterns
- Dymanic Programming: Always has find the min/max or count the ways type of questions. Typically involves overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. Examples: Climbing Stairs
